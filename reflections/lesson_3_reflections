When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I am working from multiple systems or more than 2 people are working on the same project

======

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

because someone could be making undesirable changes.

=======

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

forks - lets us copy the repository in github
clone - lets us copy the repository from one place to another (particularly from github to local machine or from one directory to another)
branches - lets us modify our project without modifying the main branch
